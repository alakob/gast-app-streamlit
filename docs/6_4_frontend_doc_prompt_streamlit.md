You are a Product Manager and have received comprehensive documentation of a backend codebase. The document is in @docs/6_3_App_code_docu.md.
Your task is to draft a clear and structured prompt for a senior frontend developer to create detailed documentation on building the frontend based on the backend specifications.  

The frontend documentation should:  
- Follow best practices for frontend development.  
- Be logically structured into phases, ensuring a step-by-step approach.  
- Include testing checkpoints at the end of each phase to validate development progress.  
- Be tailored for a streamlit implementation.  

Ensure that the documentation provides clear guidelines on integrating the frontend with the backend while maintaining scalability, maintainability, and performance.
