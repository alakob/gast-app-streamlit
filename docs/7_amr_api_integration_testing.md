# Important Areas of the AMR Predictor Application to Explore

Based on our work so far and the documents you have open, here are other important areas of the AMR Predictor application that would be valuable to explore:

## Authentication and User Management System
- You have `amr_predictor/auth/user_manager.py` open, which suggests user authentication is an important component.
- This likely handles user roles, permissions, and session management.
- Testing and ensuring the security of this component is critical for production use.

## Job Management and Scheduling
- The job archiver (`amr_predictor/maintenance/job_archiver.py`) indicates a system for managing long-running prediction jobs.
- This includes job scheduling, tracking, notification, and archiving of completed jobs.
- Testing job lifecycle, recovery from failures, and handling high concurrency would be important.

## Database Integration
- From `amr_predictor/docs/amr_sqlite_integration.md`, SQLite integration is used.
- Database schema design, query performance, and data integrity are critical areas.
- Exploring how prediction results are stored and retrieved would be valuable.

## API Layer and Endpoint Design
- The API endpoints that expose the AMR prediction functionality.
- Request validation, error handling, rate limiting, and API documentation.

## Performance Optimization
- Model loading/unloading strategies to minimize memory usage.
- Batch processing of sequences to maximize throughput.
- Caching strategies for commonly requested predictions.

## Frontend Integration and User Experience
- The Streamlit application that provides the user interface.
- How results are visualized and presented to users.
- User workflow optimization.

## Monitoring and Observability
- Logging systems to track prediction requests and errors.
- Metrics collection for model performance and system health.
- Alerting mechanisms for system failures.

## Data Security and Compliance
- How sensitive genomic data is handled and protected.
- Compliance with relevant regulations for biological data.

## Deployment and Infrastructure
- Containerization and deployment strategies.
- Scaling approaches for handling variable workloads.
- Environment configuration management.

## Documentation and Training Materials
- User guides and API documentation.
- Model performance characteristics and limitations.
- Training materials for new users.

Would you like to explore any of these areas in more detail? I could help review, test, or improve any of these components based on your priorities.
