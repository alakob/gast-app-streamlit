Implement caching for frequently accessed data
Add more batch processing options (e.g., processing multiple files)
Enhanced Documentation:
Add API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
Create more detailed examples and tutorials
Add architecture diagrams
Performance Optimizations:
Implement response streaming for large datasets
Add connection pooling for database operations
Optimize batch processing for large datasets
Would you like me to implement any of these remaining items?
