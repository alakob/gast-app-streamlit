   - Implemented environment detection and API URL selection
   - Created function to retrieve available presets
   - Added support for multiple environments (prod, staging, dev, local)

### Phase 1.4: Testing Guidelines ✅

1. **Test fixtures:**
   - Created fixtures for sample data and mock objects
   - Implemented fixtures for temporary files and directories
   - Added fixtures for mock API responses
   - Created helper functions for test setup and teardown

2. **Unit tests:**
   - Implemented tests for `BaktaClient` methods
   - Added tests for configuration management
   - Created tests for validation functions
   - Implemented tests for error handling

3. **Integration tests:**
   - Added tests for the complete Bakta API workflow
   - Implemented tests for real API interactions (with skipping mechanism)
   - Created tests that validate API responses
   - Added tests for file handling and result processing

4. **Test infrastructure:**
   - Implemented pytest configuration with custom markers
   - Added support for skipping integration tests by default
   - Created command-line option to run integration tests
   - Added test data directory for test resources

### Phase 1.5: Example Scripts and Documentation ✅

1. **Example scripts:**
   - Created examples directory with `__init__.py`
   - Implemented `run_bakta_job.py` for complete job workflow
   - Added examples for configuration management
   - Created examples for error handling

2. **Documentation:**
   - Created comprehensive README with installation and usage instructions
   - Added detailed API reference
   - Implemented example-based documentation
   - Created configuration documentation

3. **Code organization:**
   - Organized code into a proper Python package
   - Created clear separation of concerns
   - Implemented clean import structure
   - Added proper docstrings and type hints

4. **Future plans:**
   - Created database integration plan for Phase 2
   - Documented next steps and future enhancements
   - Added timeline and milestones for Phase 2
   - Prepared for future expansion
