# üìö **Detailed Explanation of the AMR Fine-Tuning Script**

---

## ‚ö°Ô∏è **Key Components and Data Flow**

### 1. **Initialization and Configuration**
- **Command-Line Parsing:**  
  - Configures the training process using input arguments.
- **Authentication Setup:**  
  - Integrates with HuggingFace Hub and Weights & Biases for model tracking.
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) Setup:**  
  - Defines LoRA parameters for efficient fine-tuning.

---

### 2. **Data Processing Pipeline**
- **FASTA File Loading:**  
  - Loads sequences with positive (AMR) and negative (non-AMR) labels.
- **Dataset Preparation:**  
  - Sequences are labeled appropriately (`AMR=1`, `non-AMR=0`).
- **Stratified Splitting:**  
  - Ensures balanced representation across train, validation, and test sets.
- **Tokenization:**  
  - Converts nucleotide sequences into token IDs for model processing.

---

### 3. **Model Setup and Customization**
- **Model Initialization:**  
  - Loads a pre-trained nucleotide transformer model.  
  - **Default Model:** `InstaDeepAI/nucleotide-transformer-v2-50m-multi-species`
- **LoRA Configuration:**  
  - Applies LoRA to enable efficient fine-tuning by adapting only specific layers.
- **Class Weight Calculation:**  
  - Accounts for class imbalance between AMR and non-AMR samples.

---

### 4. **Custom Training Process**
- **Custom Trainer Definition:**  
  - `CustomTrainer` extends the Hugging Face `Trainer` with weighted loss calculation.
- **Training Arguments:**  
  - Defines batch size, learning rate, and other hyperparameters.
- **Performance Tracking:**  
  - Monitors metrics such as:
    - Accuracy
    - F1 Score
    - Precision
    - Recall

---

### 5. **Evaluation and Deployment**
- **Model Evaluation:**  
  - Evaluates performance on the test set using multiple metrics.
  - Results are displayed in formatted tables.
- **Model Deployment:**  
  - Pushes the final model to HuggingFace Hub for sharing and deployment.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Key Dependencies**

- **PyTorch:** Core deep learning framework.  
- **Transformers:** Pre-trained models and training utilities.  
- **PEFT:** Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning library for LoRA implementation.  
- **BioPython:** Parses FASTA files.  
- **HuggingFace Hub:** For model sharing and versioning.  
- **Weights & Biases:** For experiment tracking and visualization.  
- **scikit-learn:** Computes evaluation metrics.  

---

## üéØ **Special Considerations**
- **Class Balance Handling:**  
  - Stratified sampling and weighted loss ensure class balance, which is crucial for AMR prediction where positive and negative samples may be imbalanced.
- **LoRA Efficiency:**  
  - Fine-tuning is optimized by adapting only a subset of model parameters, reducing computational cost.

This architecture effectively combines efficient model adaptation with robust data processing and evaluation, ensuring high performance in predicting antimicrobial resistance (AMR).
