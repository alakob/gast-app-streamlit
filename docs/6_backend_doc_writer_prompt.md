**Prompt:**

You are tasked with creating detailed technical documentation for a Python-based antimicrobial sequence prediction application. This documentation will be used by frontend developers to design an intuitive UI that enables multiple users to interact with the application simultaneously. The codebase includes the following core functionalities:

1. **Transformer Model Loading:**
   - Loads a pre-trained transformer model tailored for antimicrobial sequence prediction.
   - Supports potential variations, such as different model versions or configurations.

2. **Sequence Processing:**
   - Accepts user-provided sequences in various formats (e.g., FASTA, plain text).
   - Validates and preprocesses these sequences (e.g., tokenization, padding) for model input.

3. **External API for Annotations:**
   - Post-prediction, calls an external API to retrieve annotations for the sequences.
   - Manages API requests and responses, including error handling and retries.

Your documentation should adhere to best practices and include the following sections to ensure frontend developers can effectively utilize the backend to create a seamless UI:

---

### 1. Architecture Overview
   - Provide a high-level summary of the system’s components and their interactions.
   - Explain the role of the transformer model and how it integrates into the application.
   - Include a diagram (if feasible) to illustrate the data flow from user input to prediction and annotation retrieval.

---

### 2. API Endpoints
   - Document all backend API endpoints available to the frontend.
   - For each endpoint, specify:
     - **HTTP Method** (e.g., POST, GET).
     - **URL Path**.
     - **Request Parameters** (e.g., sequence data, model options).
     - **Response Format** (e.g., JSON with predictions and annotations).
     - **Authentication** requirements (if any).
     - **Rate Limits** or constraints.
   - Include example requests and responses to demonstrate usage.

---

### 3. Sequence Input and Processing
   - Detail the acceptable sequence input formats and any constraints (e.g., max length, allowed characters).
   - Describe the validation and preprocessing steps (e.g., format validation, tokenization).
   - Specify requirements the frontend must enforce to ensure valid sequence submission.

---

### 4. Model Prediction
   - Explain how the transformer model generates predictions from processed sequences.
   - Describe the prediction output format and its meaning (e.g., probability scores, labels).
   - Offer guidance on how the frontend should present these results to users.

---

### 5. External API Integration for Annotations
   - Document the process for calling the external API to fetch annotations.
   - Include:
     - **Request Format** (e.g., parameters, headers).
     - **Authentication** details (if required).
     - **Response Parsing** (e.g., extracting annotation data).
     - **Error Handling** (e.g., retries, fallbacks).
   - Advise on handling API downtime or errors in the frontend.

---

### 6. Concurrency and Performance
   - Describe mechanisms for supporting multiple concurrent users (e.g., asynchronous processing, queuing).
   - Suggest frontend strategies for efficient request handling (e.g., batching, timeouts).
   - Note any performance considerations or optimizations relevant to the UI.

---

### 7. Error Handling and Logging
   - Outline error handling throughout the codebase (e.g., invalid inputs, API failures).
   - Explain how errors are returned to the frontend (e.g., status codes, messages).
   - Detail logging practices for debugging and monitoring, and their potential use by the frontend.

---

### 8. Security Considerations
   - Describe security features, such as:
     - Input validation and sanitization.
     - Authentication/authorization mechanisms (if applicable).
     - Data encryption for sensitive information.
   - Provide frontend guidelines for secure backend interaction (e.g., HTTPS, token management).

---

### 9. Testing and Validation
   - Summarize the testing framework (e.g., unit tests, integration tests).
   - Explain how to run tests and validate predictions and annotations.
   - Include sample test cases for frontend verification.

---

### 10. Frontend Development Notes
   - Recommend UI elements or workflows for an intuitive experience (e.g., sequence upload forms, prediction progress bars).
   - Suggest handling asynchronous tasks (e.g., WebSockets, polling).
   - Highlight useful frontend tools or libraries for backend integration.

---

### Documentation Guidelines
- Write in clear, concise language, minimizing jargon where possible.
- Use code snippets, diagrams, and examples to clarify complex concepts.
- Structure the document logically with a table of contents and section headers.
- Ensure all endpoints, parameters, and responses are precisely detailed.
- Tailor the content to the frontend developers’ needs, providing everything required for a smooth UI implementation.

This documentation will empower the frontend team to build an intuitive, efficient UI for the antimicrobial sequence prediction application, fully leveraging the backend’s capabilities while supporting concurrent users effectively.
