Prompt:

"I have inherited a GitHub project repository and need to gain a comprehensive understanding of its architecture for debugging and extension. Please analyze the provided codebase and generate an elaborate Mermaid diagram that represents:

Main Components & Modules: Identify and display the primary components, services, or modules of the system.

Component Interactions: Illustrate how these components interact with each other, including control flow, dependencies, and messaging patterns.

Data Flow: Map the data flow between components, showing how data is passed, processed, and stored.

Authentication & Authorization: Highlight any authentication mechanisms, authorization flows, or security checkpoints integrated into the system.

External Integrations: Identify any external systems, APIs, or third-party services and show how they connect to the core components.

Error Handling & Logging: (If applicable) Include any error handling pathways, logging, or monitoring components.

Infrastructure & Deployment: (If applicable) Represent the infrastructure layout such as microservices, databases, and any CI/CD pipelines that interact with the code.

Additional Context: Point out any other relevant elements (such as caching layers, asynchronous processing, event-driven components, etc.) that are critical to understanding the system's overall design.

For each part of the diagram, provide a brief explanation of the component or interaction so that the architecture, data flow, and security measures of the codebase are clearly understood."
