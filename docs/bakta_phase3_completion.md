# Bakta Integration - Phase 3 Completion

This document summarizes the implementation of Phase 3 of the Bakta integration, which involved creating parsers for the result files, transformers to convert the parsed data into database models, and a storage service to coordinate the downloading and processing of files.

## Architecture Overview

The Bakta integration is structured in a layered architecture:

1. **Client Layer** (`BaktaClient`): Handles direct HTTP communication with the Bakta API
2. **Manager Layer** (`BaktaManager`): Coordinates high-level workflows and business logic
3. **Repository Layer** (`BaktaRepository`): Manages data persistence and retrieval
4. **Parser Layer** (`BaktaParser`): Parses different file formats into structured data
5. **Transformer Layer** (`BaseTransformer`): Converts parsed data into database models
6. **Storage Layer** (`BaktaStorageService`): Coordinates the downloading, parsing, and storing of results

This architecture follows the single responsibility principle, with each component focused on a specific task.

## Key Components Implemented in Phase 3

### 1. Parsers

Parsers were implemented for the following file formats:

- **GFF3Parser**: Parses General Feature Format (GFF3) files containing genome annotations
- **TSVParser**: Parses Tab-Separated Values files with annotations
- **JSONParser**: Parses JSON-formatted annotation files
- **EMBLParser**: Parses European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) files
- **GenBankParser**: Parses GenBank format files
- **FASTAParser**: Parses FASTA sequence files

Each parser inherits from the abstract `BaktaParser` base class and implements the `parse` method to extract structured data from the respective file format.

### 2. Transformers

Transformers were implemented to convert parsed data into database model objects:

- **SequenceTransformer**: Converts FASTA data into `BaktaSequence` objects
- **GFF3Transformer**: Converts GFF3 data into `BaktaAnnotation` objects
- **TSVTransformer**: Converts TSV data into `BaktaAnnotation` objects
- **JSONTransformer**: Converts JSON data into `BaktaAnnotation` objects
- **GenBankTransformer**: Converts GenBank data into `BaktaAnnotation` objects
- **EMBLTransformer**: Converts EMBL data into `BaktaAnnotation` objects

Each transformer inherits from the `BaseTransformer` base class and implements the `transform` method to convert the parsed data into model objects that can be saved in the database.

### 3. Storage Service

The `BaktaStorageService` coordinates the downloading, parsing, and storing of result files:

- Downloading result files from the Bakta API
- Parsing the files using the appropriate parsers
- Transforming the parsed data into database model objects
- Storing the transformed data in the database

The storage service supports both synchronous and asynchronous processing of files, with a thread pool for efficient parallel processing.

## Error Handling

A robust error handling strategy was implemented across all components:

- **BaktaParserError**: For errors related to parsing files
- **BaktaStorageError**: For errors related to the storage service
- Comprehensive error tracking and logging

## Usage Examples

### Basic Example

```python
from amr_predictor.bakta import BaktaManager, BaktaStorageService

# Initialize the manager
manager = BaktaManager()

# Create and start a job
job = manager.create_job(
    name="Example Job",
    config=config,
    fasta_file="/path/to/sequence.fasta"
)
manager.start_job(job.id)

# Create a storage service
storage_service = BaktaStorageService(
    repository=manager.repository,
    client=manager.client,
    results_dir="/path/to/results"
)

# Download and process results
downloaded_files = storage_service.download_result_files(job.id)
processing_results = await storage_service.async_process_all_files(job.id)

# Retrieve the processed data
result = manager.get_result(job.id)
```

A complete example is available in `examples/bakta_example.py`.

## Testing

Comprehensive test suites were implemented for each component:

- **Unit Tests**: For individual classes and methods
- **Integration Tests**: For component interactions
- **Mocks and Fixtures**: For simulating external dependencies

All tests pass, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the implementation.

## Conclusion

Phase 3 of the Bakta integration has been successfully completed, providing a robust system for processing and storing results from the Bakta annotation service. The implementation follows good software engineering principles, with clear separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and thorough testing.

The system is now ready for use in production environments and can be easily extended to support additional file formats or processing requirements in the future.
