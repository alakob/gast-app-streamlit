## Key Findings

### Module Import Issues
- `bakta_initializer.py` attempts multiple methods to import the Bakta module, suggesting path/import problems.
- Falls back to a **mock implementation** if imports fail — this may be happening silently.

### Authentication Differences
- The standalone script (`submit_bakta.py`) uses **direct API calls** without token authentication.
- The Bakta module relies on a **token-based authentication** mechanism.

### Asynchronous Function Compatibility
- The `submit_job` method in `client.py` is defined as **asynchronous (`async def`)**.
- Streamlit has limited support for async operations and requires special handling.

### Environment Variables and API Configuration
- **API URLs** and **authentication keys** are accessed differently between the standalone script and the module.
- Docker environment variable passing might be **inadequate or misconfigured**.

### Docker Volume Mounting
- Possible **path mapping issues** related to Docker volumes.
- Similar to the **AMR Predictor** volume issue mentioned in prior work.

## Action Plan

### 1. Verify API Access in Docker Container
- Create a simple diagnostic script to **test Bakta API connectivity** from within the container.
- Confirm that **environment variables** are properly accessible.

### 2. Debug Module Import Process
- Add **detailed logging** to `bakta_initializer.py` to trace which import method is used.
- Verify that the **real implementation** is used, not the mock fallback.

### 3. Analyze Async Execution
- Ensure async functions in the Bakta module are being **properly awaited** in the Streamlit app.
- Confirm that `run_async` helper in `bakta_ui.py` is handling the **asyncio event loop** correctly.

### 4. Check Docker Volume Permissions
- Ensure shared Docker volumes have **appropriate permissions**.
- Confirm **path mappings** are consistent between containers.

### 5. Compare Environment Configuration
- Create a detailed comparison of **environment variables** between the standalone script and the Docker environment.
- Pay special attention to **authentication approaches** and **API URL structures**.

### 6. Examine API Response Handling
- Investigate differences in **API response parsing** between the standalone script and the module.
- Check for **error handling** discrepancies that could cause silent failures.

Testing Bakta Unified Adapter
===========================

  ✓ Successfully imported unified adapter
  Base URL: https://bakta.computational.bio/api/v1

Key methods in unified adapter:
  - _check_if_docker
  - _map_docker_path
  - _request
  - check_job_status
  - download_all_results
  - download_result_file
  - get_job_results
  - initialize_job
  - poll_job_status
  - start_job
  - submit_job
  - upload_fasta

Checking if key methods from standalone script are implemented:
  ✓ initialize_job
  ✓ upload_fasta
  ✓ start_job
  ✓ check_job_status
  ✓ get_job_results
  ✓ download_result_file
  ✓ poll_job_status
