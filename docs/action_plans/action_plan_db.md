# Action Plan: Implementing Hybrid Database Storage for Bakta Jobs

## Phase 1: Database Design and Setup

1. **Create Database Schema**
   - Design tables for jobs, results metadata, and status history
   - Define relationships and constraints
   - Document schema with diagrams

IMPORTANT: FOR EACH IMPLEMENTATION PLEASE IMPLEMENT DETAILED LOGGING
Check if not already implemented, if not
2. **Set Up Database Infrastructure**
   - Create SQLite database file with version tracking
   - Implement database connection management
   - Add automated backup procedures

3. **Develop Database Access Layer**
   - Create CRUD operations for all entities
   - Implement transaction management
   - Add error handling and retry logic

## Phase 2: Parallel Implementation (Week 2)

1. **Add Database Support Alongside File System**
   - Modify Bakta job submission to write to both systems
   - Create background process for database-file synchronization
   - Implement in-memory caching for frequently accessed data

2. **Enhance Job Status Tracking**
   - Create status history table with timestamps
   - Add detailed logging of status changes
   - Implement database-backed polling mechanism

3. **Develop Result Metadata Storage**
   - Create tables for storing result summary data
   - Add file reference tracking for result files
   - Implement integrity checking between DB and files

## Phase 3: UI and Feature Enhancements (Week 3)

1. **Update Job Display Components**
   - Modify job listing to use database queries
   - Add filtering and sorting capabilities
   - Implement pagination for large job collections

2. **Improve Results Visualization**
   - Update results display to leverage structured data
   - Add comparative analysis features
   - Create dashboard with job statistics

3. **Implement Search Functionality**
   - Add full-text search for jobs and results
   - Create advanced filtering options
   - Add saved searches capability

## Phase 4: Migration and Testing (Week 4)

1. **Create Migration Tools**
   - Build script to import existing job files to database
   - Implement verification checks for imported data
   - Create rollback mechanism for failed migrations

2. **Conduct Testing**
   - Perform unit and integration testing
   - Test migration on copies of production data
   - Conduct performance benchmarks

3. **Develop Fallback Mechanisms**
   - Create file-based recovery procedures
   - Implement automatic database integrity checks
   - Add monitoring for database performance

## Phase 5: Deployment and Transition (Week 5)

1. **Deploy Database System**
   - Perform initial data migration
   - Enable dual-write mode during transition
   - Monitor system performance

2. **User Communication and Training**
   - Update documentation
   - Create transition guides
   - Offer support during migration period

3. **Complete Transition**
   - Gradually reduce dependency on file-based storage
   - Perform final verification of database integrity
   - Implement cleanup procedures for deprecated files

## Technical Details

- **Database**: SQLite with WAL mode for concurrent access
- **Migration Approach**: Incremental with validation at each step
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain file-based access during transition
- **Performance Consideration**: Index frequently queried fields

This phased approach ensures minimal disruption while providing incremental improvements throughout the implementation process.
