# Bakta Integration - Phase 4 Completion

This document summarizes the implementation of Phase 4 of the Bakta integration, which focused on process orchestration and job management, adding features for asynchronous processing, job monitoring, error recovery, and notification systems.

## Architecture Overview

Phase 4 builds upon the existing Bakta integration architecture, adding a new layer focused on advanced job management:

1. **Enhanced Job Management** (`BaktaJobManager`): A higher-level component that coordinates the entire workflow, including:
   - Job submission and monitoring
   - Asynchronous processing
   - Error recovery and retry mechanisms
   - Background job polling
   - Status change notifications
   - Job history tracking

This enhanced job manager builds on top of the foundation laid in previous phases:

- **Client Layer** (`BaktaClient`): Handles direct HTTP communication with the Bakta API
- **Base Manager Layer** (`BaktaManager`): Coordinates basic workflows and business logic
- **Repository Layer** (`BaktaRepository`): Manages data persistence and retrieval
- **Storage Layer** (`BaktaStorageService`): Coordinates the downloading, parsing, and storing of results

## Key Components Implemented in Phase 4

### 1. BaktaJobManager

The `BaktaJobManager` class extends the functionality of the base `BaktaManager` with advanced job management capabilities:

- **Retry Mechanism**: Automatically retries failed API calls with exponential backoff
- **Background Monitoring**: Monitors jobs in separate threads to avoid blocking the main application
- **Job Polling**: Periodically checks for status updates on all active jobs
- **Notification System**: Provides callbacks when job status changes
- **Status History**: Tracks and records all job status transitions
- **Robust Recovery**: Handles interrupted or failed jobs and provides retry functionality

### 2. Status History Tracking

A comprehensive job status history tracking system:

- Records every status change with timestamps
- Stores history in the database for persistence
- Provides methods to retrieve and analyze job history

### 3. Asynchronous Processing

The implementation includes both synchronous and asynchronous processing options:

- **Synchronous**: Blocking execution until job completes
- **Asynchronous**: Non-blocking execution with background monitoring
- **Queue-based Processing**: File processing using worker threads

## Error Handling and Recovery

A robust error handling strategy has been implemented:

- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries for transient API failures
- **Exponential Backoff**: Increasing delays between retry attempts
- **Recovery Mechanism**: System for recovering interrupted jobs
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive logging of all errors
- **Failure Handling**: Ability to retry failed jobs

## Usage Examples

### Basic Example

```python
from amr_predictor.bakta import BaktaJobManager, create_config

# Initialize the job manager
job_manager = BaktaJobManager()

# Create and submit a job
job = job_manager.submit_job(
    fasta_path="/path/to/sequence.fasta",
    name="Example Job",
    config=create_config(organism="Escherichia coli"),
    wait_for_completion=False,  # Run asynchronously
    process_results=True        # Process results when complete
)

# Start background polling for all jobs
job_manager.start_job_poller()

# Get job history
history = job_manager.get_job_history(job.id)

# Retry a failed job if needed
if job.status in ["FAILED", "ERROR"]:
    job_manager.retry_failed_job(job.id)

# Stop background polling when done
job_manager.stop_job_poller()
```

### Using Notification Callbacks

```python
def status_notification(job_id, status):
    print(f"Job {job_id} changed status to {status}")

# Initialize with notification callback
job_manager = BaktaJobManager(
    notification_callback=status_notification
)
```

A complete example is available in `examples/bakta_job_manager_example.py`.

## Testing

Comprehensive test suites were implemented for all new components:

- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual methods and features
- **Integration Tests**: Testing component interactions
- **Mock Testing**: Using mock objects to simulate external dependencies
- **Retry Testing**: Verifying retry mechanisms work correctly
- **Recovery Testing**: Ensuring interrupted jobs can be recovered

All tests pass, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the implementation.

## Conclusion

Phase 4 of the Bakta integration has been successfully completed, providing a robust job management system that handles asynchronous processing, job monitoring, error recovery, and notifications. The implementation follows good software engineering principles, with clear separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and thorough testing.

The system now supports the entire job lifecycle from submission to result processing, with robust error handling and recovery mechanisms to ensure jobs complete successfully even in the face of transient failures or interruptions.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to consider:

1. **Distributed Processing**: Support for distributed job processing across multiple nodes
2. **Job Prioritization**: Priority-based job scheduling
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Detailed metrics on job performance and resource usage
4. **Advanced Notification System**: More notification options (email, webhooks, etc.)
5. **Job Dependencies**: Support for job workflows with dependencies between jobs
