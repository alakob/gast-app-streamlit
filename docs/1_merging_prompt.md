Please analyze the attached file to understand the relationships between the scripts, as well as the flow of logic and data between them.  

Based on your analysis, propose a robust action plan to consolidate the four scripts into a single, modularized script. The merged code should be structured to allow easy importing and reuse as a module, ensuring clear separation of concerns. The goal is to integrate this module into a web-based application.  

Key requirements:  
- Modularize the code as much as possible to improve maintainability and reusability.  
- Maintain all input parameters from the three original scripts.  
- Preserve all output files from the four scripts.  
- Discard performance metrics in the merged code.  
- Implement tracking for each processing step so the UI can display the current stage of execution.

Do not Write a single line of code at this stage, just provide the action plan
